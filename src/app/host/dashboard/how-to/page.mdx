# How to run the live betting game

This version turns the classic quiz mechanic into a live betting experience for physical team challenges. There are four fixed teams (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) and the crowd bets on the team they think will **lose** the current challenge.

## Round flow

1. **Create a room** from the dashboard. Share the game URL or QR code with your audience so they can join with a nickname.
2. **Leader selection** – before each round, note who is competing ("John vs. Sarah"). This context is displayed to every player.
3. **Voting** – open the betting window so players can tap the team they believe will lose. Everyone can see incoming bets in real time.
4. **Action** – lock betting while the physical challenge happens.
5. **Resolution** – mark the team that actually lost. The system automatically rewards +1 point to everyone who guessed correctly and shows a transparency dashboard that lists who voted for each team.
6. **Repeat or finish** – start another round or end the game to reveal the final leaderboard.

## Tips for hype

- Keep the leader notes descriptive so the audience knows who is competing.
- Call out the live betting totals before locking the round.
- Use the transparency panel to celebrate accurate predictors (or tease the unlucky ones).
